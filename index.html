Hello, World!

My studies in Geneva these last 2 years have covered a wide range of issues crucial to global health. Coming from an engineering background, my mindset was on a technological approach to solving the worlds health issues, of course - surely new advances in various fields from logisitics (cold chain support) to biotech (pharma, medical devices) driven by human ingenuity and artificial intelligence are key to changing the world for the better. But I soon realized the interlinked and complex nature of these health (and more generally developmental) issues transcend borders and sectors of activity, and while technology is no doubt a game changer, the reality is vastly more complicated. A thorough understanding of the wider developmental, societal, economical, ecological, and governmental dynamics at play is essential, and is the reason for my specialization at the Graduate Institute of Geneva.
